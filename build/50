        <h1> Imad Sharaf, </h1>
        <p> 
            a 31 year old Male, Black, died on 
            1992-05-03 in Mission Hills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imad Sharaf&#39;s body was found the morning of Sunday, May 3, 1992, when firefighters answered a report of a brush fire near the on-ramp to the 405 Freeway at San Fernando Mission Boulevard in Mission Hills. At first, Sharaf, a Granada Hills resident who emigrated from Jordan three years ago, was listed as a riot victim. Detectives now believe that he was drugged before he was set ablaze and that the fire may have been an attempt to make the slaying appear riot-related. Police said that Sharaf, who was a photo lab technician, had been doused with a flammable substance and set afire.
