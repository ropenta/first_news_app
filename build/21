            Andreas Garnica, a 36-year-old Latino, was stabbed to death Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Pico-Union. Garnica was attacked in the 2000 block of West Pico Boulevard during a drug deal and street robbery. Detectives were unable to find the family of Adolfo Morales, also known as Andres J. Garnica, until they received a lead through a wire service reporter&#39;s inquiry.
